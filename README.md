#  Exoplanet Classifier (Frontend)

This is the **frontend** of the Exoplanet Classifier project. It provides a responsive and user-friendly interface for classifying exoplanets based on their parameters. Users can input planetary data and instantly receive predictions powered by a machine learning model.

Built with **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, this frontend ensures speed, clarity, and responsiveness across all devices.

##  Backend API

The **backend API** for this project was developed and deployed by a teammate.
It provides endpoints for predicting exoplanet classifications using a trained machine learning model.

You can explore the backend API documentation here:

###  API Request Details

####  Single Prediction

To make a single prediction, send a POST request with the following JSON body to the backend API endpoint:

```json
{
  "depth": 0.01,
  "duration": 2.5,
  "eccentricity": 0.05,
  "inclination": 89.5,
  "period": 3.52,
  "radius": 1.2,
  "semi_major_axis": 0.05,
  "snr": 15.5,
  "stellar_mass": 1.0,
  "stellar_radius": 1.0,
  "stellar_temp": 5778
}
```

 **Endpoint:**

```
POST https://touseefahmad-nasa-exoplanet-docker.hf.space/predict_single
```

#### ðŸ”¹ Bulk Prediction

For bulk predictions, upload a CSV file containing multiple records.
You can use the following **sample dataset** to test the API:
